## Changelog

### v0.5.0 (2019-03-26)

Note: this project wouldn't probably be updated a lot, due to me re-thinking the architecture of the bemto-components as a whole, this is a maintainance update in order to allow usage of the newer version of styled-components.

- Updated the version of styled-components.
- Updated some of the deps.

### v0.4.0 (2018-04-05)

- Added stylelint (don't seem to work for some reason O_o?).
- Updated deps.

### v0.3.0 (2018-03-05)

- Moved styled-components to peer dependency.

### v0.2.0 (2018-03-05)

- Updated deps (bemto-components & styled-components).
- kizu/bemto-components â†’ bemto/bemto-components.
